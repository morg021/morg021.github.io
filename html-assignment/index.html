        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I am a <em>positive</em> personality who loves nature and travelling. I have been to more than forty countries 
            in the world. My favourite place to visit is Paris in France. It's such an archetectural beauty veiwing the structres of the 
            streets of Paris. The famous of them all is the Eiffel tower. A very tall metallic edifice that can be viewed around 
            the city. I love classical music like Nostalgia by Yanni.</p>

        <p>My favourite sport is soccer and I am a fan of <abbr title="Manchester United">Man U</abbr> Soccer
             club of England. They always sign talented plays and often end a season with trophies. They won the the 7<sup>th</sup> English
             premier league in 10years.
             Science is my best subject; The Earth is made up of 70% H<sub>2</sub>O, and 30% is Land.
              <q>Science is a way of equipping yourself with the tools to interpret what happens in front of you.</q> -<cite>Neil deGrasse Tyson</cite></p>
